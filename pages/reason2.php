    <h1>Reason 2: Extinction of creatures found nowhere else on the planet</h1>

    <p>The creatures of the deep sea, specially adapted to live in the extreme alien environment
    of the ocean depths, almost look like something from another planet. From ‘zombie worms’ discovered in 2002, 
    to a transparent anemone that can eat worms six times its own mass, the deep seas are full of weird and 
    wonderful creatures. At one of the target sites for mining, 85% of the wildlife living around hydrothermal vents
    are found nowhere else in the oceans.</p>
    
    <p>Shockingly, licences have already been granted to explore for mining potential at vents, 
    including the incredible Lost City in the middle of the Atlantic.
    Mining machines grinding up and destroying the habitats that these creatures are specifically designed
    to live in means they could never recover – risking the extinction of unique species.
    The physical recovery of the nodules that mining companies want to extract takes millions of years,
    and we do not know if creatures dependent on nodules can recover after their removal. </p>

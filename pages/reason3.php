    <h1>Reason 3: Disturbing one of our best allies against climate change </h1>

    <p>The deep sea is an incredibly important store of ‘blue carbon’, 
    the carbon that is naturally absorbed by marine life, and which remains stored in 
    deep sea sediment for thousands of years after these creatures die – helping to 
    slow climate change. </p>

    <p>But by impacting on natural processes that store carbon, 
    deep sea mining could even make climate change worse. 
    The disruption caused by the machines may release carbon stored in deep sea sediments, 
    and the wider impacts could disrupt the processes that store carbon in those sediments. </p>

    <p>We know that we are facing a climate emergency. Why would we make it worse for ourselves?!</p>

    <h1>Reason 5: Do we want to destroy wonders that we are yet to discover and properly understand?</h1>

    <p>So far, we’ve only explored 0.0001% of the deep seafloor to see what lives there. 
    We have so much more to learn about the deep ocean’s wildlife and ecosystems. 
    How can companies properly risk manage something that we are yet to fully understand?
    There could be many more risks than they are aware of, from opening a new 
    industrial frontier in the largest ecosystem on Earth. Without proper protection of the deep sea,
    we could destroy species and ecosystems yet to even be discovered.</p>

    <p>No minerals or metals are worth destroying ecosystems we don’t even understand yet. 
    Companies that use these materials for smartphones and renewable energy should be investing
    in recycling and new technology instead of threatening marine life for profit.</p>
    
    <b>It’s clear that deep sea mining would be very bad news for our oceans.</b><br><br>

    <p>And the corporations that want to get going with this destructive practice know the risks.
    Just as the oil industry spent years downplaying the environmental risks of their product while
    convincing politicians it was essential for the economy, so now deep sea mining companies are 
    trying to convince politicians they offer a “green solution”. This isn’t true. </p>

    <p>Let’s not repeat our mistakes and let this risky industry get a grip on our deep seas.
    With the nature and climate crises that we are facing, the stakes are simply too high. 
    We shouldn’t be asking ‘how much new harm will we allow?’ – we should be making ambitious plans
    to help our oceans recover to health. </p>

    <p>To help make this happen we are building an unstoppable global movement for healthy oceans, 
    to protect nature and tackle climate change. So far over 900,000 people globally have signed our petition,
    calling on governments to agree a Global Ocean Treaty next year, which can put vast areas off-limits 
    to exploitation and raise environmental standards for any industrial activity in international waters,
    putting protection at the heart of how we collectively manage our global oceans. 
    A strong Global Ocean Treaty can help protect the hidden treasures of the deep sea from reckless exploitation.</p>

    <p>The deep sea is the largest ecosystem on Earth. We should protect it and learn from it, not mine it.</p>
